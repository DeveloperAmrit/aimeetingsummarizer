Technical Discussion:
Emma reported that the authentication module integration took longer than expected due to third-party API limitations. The team spent extra time implementing fallback mechanisms.

David presented new wireframes for the dashboard redesign. The team agreed on the simplified navigation approach but requested changes to the color scheme.
